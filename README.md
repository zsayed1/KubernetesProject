# KubernetesProject

Since kubenetes is a complex structure. It takes a while to understand it and work on it. To learn, I enrolled in an interesting course about kubenetes for beginners and thought to create my own repo for documenting the knowledge for future use. I have learned, explored and performed various operations on kubernetes, which are as follows:-

* Installing ***kubernetes and minikube*** for testing the cluster locally.
* Deploying a basic ***tomcat server*** to learn how to create, apply, expose and describe a deployment.
* Creating ***health checks*** on the deployment.
* Then ***replicating*** the deployment by defining the deployment and by passing the replication command with the kubectl.
* Demo of creating ***labels*** and selecting the particular pod with the help of ***node Selector***  
* I also learned how kubelet tell indiividual containers to use ***DNS service IP*** to resolve DNS name.
* How ***namespaces*** creates a small logical containers internally to seperate clusters.
* How stateless containers can be mounted with ***persistent disk to create statefull*** enviornment.
* How ***autoscalling*** is performed?
* What are ***secrets***? 
* How ***usage and resource monitoring*** is done.
. After then I used AWS to run the actual kubenetes cluster and work on it.

## So what exactly is Kubernetes?

* Kubernetes is a container orchestration standard that defines relationships between containers. It defines where the containers come from? how they are scaled? how they are connected and how they work?

* Basically it a standardizes the containers to make usable software.

* It was developed by Google in 2014 and its first version came in 2015.

* It is also abbreviated as K8s
